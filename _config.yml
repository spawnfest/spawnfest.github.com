              <dl class=\"pl-3\">
                <dt>Creativity</dt><dd>This category assigns points for unexpectedness, eccentricity, fun. This is a broad category that may apply to the project, its code, the team, etc.</dd>
                <dt>Usefulness</dt><dd>How useful the project will be for its target users. Does it solve an existing problem? Does it significantly reduce work time for its users?</dd>
                <dt>Innovation</dt><dd>How groundbreaking the project is. The more unique and unprecedented the idea behind the project, the better. Also applies to projects developed in a unique way.</dd>
                <dt>Correctness</dt><dd>The less bugs, the better. This category values working products over complete ones.</dd>
                <dt>Maintainability</dt><dd>How easy will it be for future developers to keep contributing to this project after SpawnFest is over.</dd>
                <dt>Completion</dt><dd>Is the project functional? Did the team get to a point where there is something to show, even if there are a few bugs here and there?</dd>
              </dl>
              "
      - text: "The final score of each team will be computed as the sum of the points received in all those categories. The team with the highest final score will be the winner of the contest."
      - text: "As long as there are more prizes, those will be awarded to runner-up teams."
      - text: "Prizes gifted from sponsors shall be distributed among all winning teams and players at the organizer's discretion.

      - text: "Event organizers reserve the right to change these rules without prior notification, up until 5 days before the event starts."

ideas:
  - title: Add branch coverage to cover
    description: Add branch coverage to cover, so that if you see expr1() orelse expr2() and the right-hand side of an orelse is never invoked in the test, the line is shown as yellow (partially covered)
  - title: Dialyzer Simplifier
    description: We always complain about the cryptic (but right, though!) messages Dialyzer generates. It would be amazing to create something to help newcomers (and experienced devs alike) understand them better.
  - title: rebar3 vendor plugin
    description: Create a rebar3 plugin that vendors in dependencies from multiple sources (paths, Git, Hex, etc.). Said plugin would properly handle renaming files and module names per consumer configuration.
  - title: visual code coverage reporting tool with history
    description: A tool that keeps history of coverage percentage and allows displaying results in a visual fashion (e.g. like a graph with the run id on the x axis and the coverage percentage on the y axis)
  - title: Native secrets library for projects
    description: A tool to allow storing secrets in Git (or another CVS) with minimal configuration effort, native to BEAM
    (from https://github.com/elasticdog/transcrypt: configure transparent encryption of sensitive files stored in a Git repository)
  - title: Pretty diff support for common tests
    description: A library that provides assertions which produce pretty diffs a la ExUnit on match and comparison assertions.
  - title: Recurring event site
    description: A website to organize recurring events (in the style of Meetup but for stuff that happens every week). I'm thinking about... say... a group of friends that gather every week in the same place to play soccer, watch movies, read books, or hike.
  - title: A public sports field status tracker app/website.
    description: This service would allow players to share the status of public sports facilities (i.e. table tennis tables, basketball rings, soccer fields, etc.) around the city. You will be able to know if they're free or if your friends are there or even what's the weather like there, without actually moving to that location.
  - title: An auto-emoji creator for Slack/Discord
    description: A Slack plugin that when you write ":bananas:", if there is no emoji yet for that‚Ä¶ it will try to guess what you mean by that, find out a proper image for it, and upload it to that Slack workspace so that ":bananas:" immediately turns into üçå  without you having to actually create that emoji yourself.
  - title: Distributed systemd scheduler
    description: A BEAM based implementation of fleetctl from CoreOS
  - title: RSS/email/NNTP client
    description: would work similarly to Hey.com, but would allow reading news and mailing groups in tree-like format
  - title: Vulnerabilities store
    description: An application that tracks vulnerabilities in BEAM libs and applications. Said application would work with https://hex.pm, utilizing CycloneDX SBoM and providing an API for GitHub/GitLab for generating security notifications.
  - title: Calendar library in Erlang
    description: Calendar library with TZ support, sub second support, and anything else the current calendar module in Erlang/OTP is missing.
  - title: Unicode manipulation library
    description: The string module does not provide a number of operations that have to be implemented by hand (such as removing accented characters). Support for Unicode codepoint properties ala libicu. Support for decoding/encoding UTF-8 from/to various other character encodings would also be useful, for example when dealing with email data.
  - title: Hedy on the BEAM
    description: Implement Hedy on the BEAM. See <a href="https://www.hedycode.com/">Hedy Code</a> for details.
  - title: Leex column number support
    description: Currently Leex https://erlang.org/doc/man/leex.html the lexical analyser generator for Erlang does not support column numbers for the generated scanners. The returned tokens contain only a line number and not a tuple of {line(), column()}. This doesn't matter for the Erlang compiler because it doesn't use a leex generated scanner but all languages that do use leex can't support column numbers in error messages because of that. For backwards compatibility this should probably be optional. Optimally such a project could target itself for inclusion in Erlang/OTP.
  - title: Generic non-deterministic user level scheduler
    description: Create a general purpose non-deterministic user level scheduler that generates random schedules, provides hook for shrinking, and produces seeds for repeatability ala PULSE in QuickCheck.
  - title: Erlang Code Improver
    description: We have <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/inaka/elvis">Elvis</a> which will show places where we can improve our code, but it won't fix them. It would be cool to go one step further and build something to apply changes to our code to improve it.
  - title: copyright-header creator/updater
    description: a copyright-header-creator lib. (add an easy copyright - or update an existing one - to all your source files) - might have to deal with parse_trans or regexp
  - title: Some Application
    description: If you feel adventurous, why not implement something suggested by <a target="_blank" href="https://appideagenerator.com/">The App Idea Generator</a>?
  - title: A Game
    description: Pick your favorite game and make a server for it, like we did with <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/inaka/serpents">Serpents</a>. You can make it so the clients can be bots, or they can connect through an API or you can actually provide a visual interface to the game.
  - title: dependency upgrade suggestion system
    description: have a way to, given a folder full of random projects (e.g. rebar3 or mix -based) determine what would be the best way to bump deps in them tree analysis + upstream analysis (think <a href="https://github.com/AdRoll/rebar3_depup">AdRoll/rebar3_depup</a> but for a complete tree)
